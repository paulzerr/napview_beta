# napview: Sleep Staging and Analysis Software

```napview``` is a powerful and user-friendly software for real-time sleep staging in the sleep lab. 

## Installation

**1.** Make sure you have Python 3.8 or later installed on your system. pip and venv is typically included, otherwise, install manually. [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)<br>


**2.** Create a new virtual environment (venv):

   <i>Note: using a virtual environment is not strictly necessary to run napview, but is highly recommended to ensure compatibility.</i><br>

   - Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to create the venv and run:
     
     ```
     python -m venv napview_venv
     ```
   - Activate the virtual environment:

   macOS and Linux:
     
     ```
     source napview_venv/bin/activate
     ```

   Windows:
     
     ```
     napview_venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

**3.** Install napview:
   
   ```
   pip install napview
   ```

**4.** Start napview from a terminal or command prompt:
   
   ```
   napview
   ```

**5.** Alternatively you can download the github repository, install the dependencies and start napview by executing the napview.py script.



## Dependencies

These packages will automatically be installed via pip. Otherwise install manually.

pip install mne==1.7.1 yasa==0.6.5 pylsl==1.16.2 peewee==3.17.6 numpy==2.0.0 PyQt6==6.7.0 thread==2.0.5 usleep_api==0.1.3 Flask==3.0.3 



## Compatibility 

- napview has been tested with BrainVision EEG amplifiers.

- In principle, any amplifier with real-time streaming capabilities can be used with napview via a [LSL connector script](https://labstreaminglayer.readthedocs.io/info/supported_devices.html). These are available for most EEG amps, or you can create your own.

- Feel free to contact us for assistance to make napview work in your lab setup.
